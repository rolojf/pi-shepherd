# pi-shepherd

pi-shepherd is a no-fuss extension for native, low-level Herdr agent orchestration. The **Shepherd**—your main pi session—can launch and coordinate specialized agents in visible Herdr panes, while shared session fieldnotes (artifacts) let agents share context across delegated work.

## Key Features

-   **Native, no-fuss, low-level Herdr agent orchestration** — Shepherd uses native Herdr panes for all agents and simple, open primitives for agent orchestration. Everything is visible and inspectable. Shepherd does not impose a workflow; it gives you the tools to build your own.
-   **Herdr headless support** — work inside Herdr or from a plain terminal while keeping launched agents visible and inspectable in Herdr.
-   **Granular system-prompt and agent-context support** — Shepherd goes beyond standard definitions and utilises pi's open system-prompt. Shepherd agents can be defined with granular control over context for very specific and narrow agent and context control.
-   **Manual agent launch** — start an interactive specialist directly with `/shepherd spawn` and chat with it in its own pi session.
-   **Shared pi-session fieldnotes (artifacts)** — give agents a durable shared place to leave notes and share context across delegated work.

## Requirements

-   [pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi)
-   [Herdr](https://github.com/herdrdev/herdr)
-   Node.js 22 or newer

## Install

Install the package using pi’s package installer:

```bash
pi install npm:@luminascale/pi-shepherd
```

Reload pi, then verify that the extension is available:

```text
/shepherd agents
```

You should see the bundled agent definitions, including `scout`, `planner`, `worker`, and `reviewer`.

## Available tools

pi-shepherd exposes these tools to the Shepherd. You can use them explicitly when you need precise control, but ordinary natural-language requests are the recommended starting point:

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `shepherd` | List definitions (`agents`), list active agents (`herd`), or remove stale pane registrations (`prune`) |
| `shepherd_spawn` | Create an idle persistent agent |
| `shepherd_delegate` | Start a tracked task; returns immediately with a task ID |
| `shepherd_message` | Send an asynchronous message (parent or peer); `expectsReply` opens a tracked reply request |
| `shepherd_watch` | Receive task completion without blocking the current turn (task IDs preferred, legacy prompt IDs still work) |
| `shepherd_status` | Inspect an agent without focusing its pane; reports process and task state independently |
| `shepherd_close` | Close an owned agent, cancel its active task, and clear pending requests |
| `shepherd_read` | Read recent terminal output for diagnostics |
| `shepherd_prompt` | **Deprecated** one-turn compatibility path; prefer `shepherd_delegate` for tracked work |

Child agents additionally see `shepherd_message` (talk to the parent or a peer) and `shepherd_done` (the only normal successful completion of their tracked task).

## Your first delegation

You do not need to call Shepherd’s tools yourself. After restarting pi, describe the work you want done in your normal conversation, or nudge the Shepherd to delegate it explicitly. Phrases such as “use Shepherd,” “ask the herd,” “ask a sheep,” “delegate this,” “orchestrate a review,” or “use a subagent” are all natural-language requests; no special syntax is required. For example:

> Ask a planner to create an implementation plan for adding authentication, including the relevant files and recommended steps.

The Shepherd starts the planner in a visible Herdr tab, gives it the task, collects its result, and reports back to you. This is the recommended one-shot workflow. Shepherd’s structured tools are still available when you need explicit lifecycle control, parallel work, or want to inspect what the Shepherd is doing; see [Placement and lifecycle](#placement-and-lifecycle) below.

### Work directly with a specialist agent

If you would rather work with a specialist directly, use the human command surface described in the [Command reference](#command-reference). Switch to the new Herdr tab to chat with the planner. Spawning creates an idle, persistent agent; it does not submit a task. Close interactive agents when you are finished so your Herdr session does not accumulate unnecessary panes.

## Common workflows

### Sequential work

Use sequential delegation when one agent’s result should inform the next agent’s task. Describe the handoff in your request:

> Ask a planner to create an implementation plan for adding authentication. Once it has finished, give its plan to a worker and ask the worker to implement the feature. Return the implementation result when it is complete.

The Shepherd waits for the planner before starting the worker and passes the planner’s result along as context. This is useful for plan-then-implement, research-then-review, or any workflow with a clear handoff.

### Parallel work

Use parallel delegation when tasks are independent. Ask the Shepherd to delegate them together:

> Ask two scouts to work in parallel: have one research how authentication is implemented and the other research authorization. Wait for both results, then summarize the findings and explain any relevant connections.

The Shepherd runs the independent tasks concurrently and combines their results. This is useful for comparing approaches, investigating separate parts of a codebase, or getting multiple reviews of the same change.

### Delegate, then watch

The tracked-task workflow is: spawn, delegate, watch, close. `shepherd_delegate` starts the work and returns immediately with a **task ID**; nothing is settled until the child calls `shepherd_done` (or the task fails, is cancelled, or times out).

```text
shepherd_spawn({ agent: "worker", label: "auth" })
shepherd_delegate({ target: "<agent ID>", task: "Implement the auth middleware from the plan." })
shepherd_watch({ id: "<task ID>" })
```

When the task settles, the watcher delivers a completion notification containing the result. Delivery uses pi's steer mode: if the Shepherd is mid-turn, the notification is injected between tool rounds (before cleanup calls such as `shepherd_close`); if the Shepherd is idle, it triggers a new turn immediately. Watchers finish automatically after all their tasks settle; they do not close agents. Use `shepherd_watch` for non-blocking completion notifications and `shepherd_status` to inspect intermediate task state.

### Messaging between agents

Agents in the same project can message each other through the parent broker. The child's `shepherd_message` tool can target `parent` or an owned agent ID. A peer question that requires an answer is sent with `expectsReply: true`:

```text
shepherd_message({
  target: "<planner agent ID>",
  message: "Which retry backoff should the middleware use?",
  taskId: "<own task ID>",
  expectsReply: true
})
```

The angle-bracket values above are documentation placeholders only. At runtime,
copy the planner's exact `id` from `shepherd_spawn` into `target`; do not use
`planner`, a display label, or a Herdr pane ID. Invalid targets are rejected.

While the answer is outstanding, the sender's task is `waiting` — even though its pi process is `idle` and the child's turn has ended. The reply (correlated by `replyTo`) returns the task to `running`; a `shepherd_done`, cancellation, or the reply deadline settle it. Delivery modes: `followUp` (default) queues the message for the recipient's next turn; `steer` injects it urgently into an active turn. Child requests (`expectsReply: true`) and replies wake the parent at the next safe boundary (between tool rounds when the Shepherd is mid-turn, immediately when it is idle); ordinary informational messages remain passive. A wake-up never interrupts an active tool call.

### Continue working while an agent runs

`shepherd_watch({ id: prompt.id })` is also non-blocking for the legacy prompt path; completion arrives as a steered notification.

### Compatibility

`shepherd_prompt` is a **deprecated** one-turn compatibility path: each prompt still completes at the end of that child turn (that semantics is unchanged and documented, not silently altered). Use `shepherd_delegate` instead for any work that may need to answer or receive a reply. `shepherd_watch` accepts task IDs (`shepherd_delegate`) and legacy prompt IDs (`shepherd_prompt`) and returns immediately; completions arrive as steered notifications. Use `shepherd_status` to inspect running or waiting tasks.

## Agent definitions

Agent definitions are Markdown files, so you can tune an agent’s behavior with granular system-prompt engineering. Define its role, workflow, tools, model, and prompt options in YAML frontmatter and the Markdown body. The supported frontmatter fields are:

| Field | Values | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **`name`** | String | — | The agent’s name. **Required.** |
| **`description`** | String | — | A short description shown during discovery. **Required.** |
| **`tools`** | Comma-separated string or YAML list | pi’s default tools | Tools available to the agent. |
| **`model`** | Provider-qualified model, `null`, or `default` | Shepherd’s model | Select the model, for example `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5`. `null`, `default`, or omission inherits the Shepherd’s model. |
| **`omit-system-prompt`** | `true`, `false` | `false` | Omit pi’s built-in system prompt when `true`. |
| **`omit-pi-documentation`** | `true`, `false` | `false` | Omit pi’s built-in documentation guidance when `true`. |
| **`omit-context-files`** | `true`, `false` | `false` | Omit automatic `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` context-file loading when `true`. |
| **`user-invocable`** | `true`, `false` | `true` | Indicate whether the agent is intended to be directly invoked by a user. |

For example:

```markdown
---
name: tester
description: Runs and evaluates GUI tests
tools: read, grep, find
model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5
omit-system-prompt: false
omit-pi-documentation: true
omit-context-files: true
user-invocable: true
---

You are a focused GUI testing specialist. Report reproducible failures
with exact steps and useful evidence.
```


### Bundled definitions and discovery

The bundled agent definitions are:

-   `scout` — fast codebase investigation
-   `planner` — planning and decomposition
-   `worker` — implementation work
-   `reviewer` — review and verification

User and project definitions can add or override these names. Pi project trust is required before Shepherd reads project configuration or project agent directories; unknown or declined trust fails closed. Discovery precedence is:

1.  `~/.pi/agent/agents/`
2.  `~/.agents/agents/`
3.  nearest project `.pi/agents/`
4.  nearest project `.agents/agents/`
5.  bundled `.pi/agents/`
6.  bundled `.agents/agents/`

User-level discovery is the default. Project definitions are repo-controlled, require Pi trust for the current project, explicitly selecting project/both scope, and per-spawn confirmation when running interactively. If confirmation is enabled but no UI is available, the spawn is rejected. The bundled definitions can be disabled from settings. Agents retain the host user’s normal pi tool permissions.

## Placement and lifecycle

By default, `shepherd_spawn` creates a background Herdr tab. You can request a pane or workspace placement:

```text
shepherd_spawn({
  agent: "worker",
  label: "implementation",
  placement: "pane_right", // pane_right, pane_down, tab, or workspace
})
```

The working directory defaults to the Shepherd session and `cwd` can be supplied when spawning. Project trust does not widen to a different spawn cwd: project configuration and project agents are available only for the current session cwd; user and bundled agents remain usable elsewhere. The child model is selected only by the discovered agent definition; omission, `null`, or `default` inherits the Shepherd session model. Agent scope, project approval, and prompt-shaping options come from Shepherd settings and the discovered agent definition; they are not spawn overrides.

Lifecycle tools use short, opaque, session-scoped IDs:

```text
shepherd_spawn    -> agent ID      (for delegate, message, status, close)
shepherd_delegate -> task ID       (for watch, wait, message taskId, shepherd_done)
shepherd_message  -> message ID    (answer it with replyTo)
```

Task IDs identify the unit of work; message IDs identify individual envelopes and only matter when correlating a reply (the answering participant sets the request's message ID as `replyTo`). When the Shepherd answers a child-originated request, the parent resolves its own pending request as soon as that reply is queued, so the child does not need to send a redundant acknowledgment before calling `shepherd_done`. Do not substitute a Herdr pane ID for any of these. Pane IDs are only diagnostic targets for `shepherd_read`.

## Command reference

The slash command is useful when you want to manage an agent directly rather than ask the Shepherd to orchestrate a task:

```text
/shepherd agents                # list available definitions
/shepherd agents both           # include project definitions
/shepherd herd                  # list active agents
/shepherd spawn worker          # spawn an interactive agent
/shepherd status worker         # inspect an agent
/shepherd read worker --lines=20
/shepherd settings
```

Supported actions are `agents`, `herd`, `prune`, `spawn`, `status`, `read`, and `settings`. `/shepherd list` remains a compatibility alias for `/shepherd agents`. Optional spawn flags include: `--placement pane_right|pane_down|tab|workspace` and `--cwd <path>`.

For one-shot delegation, prompting, waiting, parallel work, and opaque-ID lifecycle control, use the structured `shepherd_*` tools instead of manual commands. The old single-tool form such as `shepherd({ action: "prompt", ... })` is no longer supported.

## Settings

Open `/shepherd` or `/shepherd settings` to configure pi-shepherd. The menu
shows the effective values for the current workspace; use the arrow keys and
Enter to cycle values, `/` to fuzzy-search, and `Esc` to close it.

| Option | Values | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Settings scope** (`projectScope`) | `user`, `project` | `user` | Select the settings source for this workspace. A dormant project file is shown as `user (project file dormant)`. |
| **Agent scope** (`agentScope`) | `user`, `project`, `both` | `user` | Select which agent definition directories are searched. Project agents are repository-controlled. |
| **Include bundled agents** (`includeBundledAgents`) | on, off | on | Include the built-in `scout`, `planner`, `worker`, and `reviewer` definitions in discovery. |
| **Confirm project agents** (`confirmProjectAgents`) | on, off | on | User-only security setting. A project config cannot disable confirmation for project-local agents. |
| **Keep tab open after done** (`keepOpen`) | on, off | on | Leave the Herdr tab open after an agent completes so its output can be inspected. |
| **Keep agent alive after done** (`stayOpen`) | on, off | off | Keep the agent's pi process alive after completion so you can continue driving it in its tab. |
| **Enable fieldnotes** (`fieldnotes`) | on, off | on | Create durable shared session notes for delegated prompts. Changes take effect when the next pi session starts. |
| **Use sheep emoji** (`emojiSheep`) | on, off | on | Show the animated `🐑` marker beside actively working agents; off uses a plain marker instead. |
| **Default run timeout** (`timeout`) | `1`, `2`, `5`, `10`, `20`, `30`, or `60` minutes | `20` minutes | Set the default time limit before a Herdr run is reported as timed out. |
| **Stale wait reminder** (`staleWaitThreshold`) | `off`, `1`, `2`, `5`, `10`, `15`, or `30` minutes | `5` minutes | A task waiting longer than this on a required reply raises one stale-wait reminder. `off` disables reminders; reminders never cancel or block the task. |

The user layer is stored in `pi-shepherd/config.json` inside the active pi
agent directory (`~/.pi/agent` by default, or `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`). It stores
personal values only. The project layer is `.shepherd/config.json` in the
current working directory, with no walk-up. Pi must trust the current project
before Shepherd reads this file; missing or declined trust uses only the user
layer. Once trusted, a project file is active only when it contains
`"projectScope": true`; when active, it is self-contained and missing
project-owned fields fall back to built-in defaults rather than private user
values. A project file with `projectScope: false` or no flag is dormant.

`confirmProjectAgents` is intentionally user-owned. A committed project file
may select repository-controlled agent definitions through `agentScope`, but it
cannot disable the confirmation gate. An explicit user-level opt-out remains
the user's responsibility.

For example:

```jsonc
// ~/.pi/agent/pi-shepherd/config.json — personal values
{
  "agentScope": "both",
  "includeBundledAgents": true,
  "confirmProjectAgents": true,
  "keepOpen": true,
  "stayOpen": false,
  "fieldnotes": true,
  "emojiSheep": true,
  "timeout": 20,
  "staleWaitThreshold": 5
}

// .shepherd/config.json — optional, self-contained project values
{
  "agentScope": "project",
  "includeBundledAgents": true,
  "keepOpen": true,
  "stayOpen": false,
  "fieldnotes": true,
  "emojiSheep": true,
  "timeout": 30,
  "staleWaitThreshold": 5,
  "projectScope": true
}
```

Project settings are intended to be optionally committed. Since `.shepherd/`
also contains runtime fieldnote sessions, use this pattern when sharing only
the config:

```gitignore
.shepherd/*
!.shepherd/config.json
```

When a delegated task is **waiting** on a required reply (set with
`shepherd_message` + `expectsReply`, or set by the child asking another
participant), it can sit there for a while if the target is busy.
`staleWaitThreshold` controls how long a task may wait before the parent
receives a **single** stale-wait reminder naming the task, the question, the
target, and how long it has been waiting. The reminder is informational: it
never cancels, times out, or blocks the task. The task's own reply deadline
(`timeout`) remains the authoritative bound and settles the task as `blocked`
if the reply never comes. A reply (or the task resuming/completing) clears the
episode, so the same wait never re-notifies while open.

## Diagnostic tools

These commands are primarily useful for contributors and local development checkouts. Use the diagnostic extractor when you need to see the fully assembled prompt that pi will give the Shepherd or a discovered agent:

```bash
npm run extract:system-prompt -- shepherd
npm run extract:system-prompt -- agent scout --scope both --cwd /path/to/project
npm run extract:system-prompt -- agent scout --output /tmp/scout-system.md
npm run extract:system-prompt -- shepherd --json
```

This captures the prompt at pi’s `before_agent_start` hook without making a provider request. Project-agent diagnostics use Pi’s current trust decision; missing or declined trust fails closed. For the full prompt-composition workflow and troubleshooting, see the [Diagnostics guide](docs/diagnostics.md).

### Inspect active agents

```text
/shepherd herd
```

The command lists all active agents currently detected in Herdr. For one agent, use `/shepherd status` or `/shepherd read`.

### Reading status

`shepherd_status` reports **process state and task state independently**. A process can be `idle` while its delegated task is still `waiting` on a required reply, and one can be `working` while its task is `running`. When an agent owns an open task the status also includes the task ID, how long it has been `waiting`, the pending request (message) ID, the agent the reply is expected from, and a `stale` flag once a stale-wait reminder has fired.

The persistent "below the editor" widget tracks the same two dimensions: it lists agents that are `working` **or** that are idle-but-`waiting` on a required reply (so an idle child parked on a peer reply is never hidden as done). Waiting rows render distinctly, show how long the wait has lasted, and name the agent being waited on; a `stale` wait is flagged. Pane and task IDs never leak into the display — rows use only display names.

## Fieldnotes

When fieldnotes are enabled, all agents orchestrated by one Shepherd session in the same project share a durable note session:

```text
.shepherd/sessions/NNNN-orchestrator-<id>/
├── session.json
├── shepherd.md
└── <agent>-NN.md
```

`shepherd.md` is the shared index, and each delegated prompt receives its own note. Notes are retained after waiting, closing, timeout, or extension restart; pi-shepherd does not automatically delete, archive, commit, or check them out. The fieldnotes setting is session-scoped, so start a new Shepherd session after changing it. Existing agents retain the current session’s behavior.

## Troubleshooting

### An agent is not responding

Inspect its state and terminal output:

```text
/shepherd status <agent>
/shepherd read <agent>
```

### There are too many Herdr panes

The slash command does not close lifecycle-managed agents. Use `shepherd_close` with the agent ID returned by `shepherd_spawn`:

```text
shepherd_close({ id: agent.id })
```

### There are stale pane registrations

Remove registrations for panes that no longer exist:

```text
/shepherd prune
```

## Herdr runtime and safety

pi-shepherd uses the `herdr` CLI and never uses an invisible subprocess fallback. It works inside Herdr or from a plain terminal by ensuring a headless Herdr server is available. Background tabs use `--no-focus`, preserve the requested working directory, and remain visible for inspection.

Only panes recorded in pi-shepherd’s created-pane registry may be closed by the extension. Temporary launch and session resources are cleaned only after the child pane is confirmed gone.
